This is a Job Application backend built using Microservices architecture to understand real-world service communication and scalable system design.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview
- Microservices-based architecture
- Service discovery using Eureka Server
- API Gateway for request routing
- Synchronous inter-service communication using OpenFeign
- Asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ
- Spring Boot applications containerized using Docker

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud (Eureka, OpenFeign, API Gateway)
- RabbitMQ
- Docker
- Maven
- MySQL
- Git

## 🔄 Communication
- **Synchronous:** REST APIs using OpenFeign
- **Asynchronous:** Event-based communication using RabbitMQ

## 📌 Key Learnings
- Designing loosely coupled microservices
- Handling service discovery and routing
- Implementing synchronous and asynchronous communication
- Running Spring Boot applications in Docker containers

## 🚀 How to Run (High Level)
1. Start Eureka Server
2. Start API Gateway
3. Start individual microservices
4. Start RabbitMQ
5. Run services using Docker or locally
